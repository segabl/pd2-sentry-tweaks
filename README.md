# Sentry Tweaks

This mod tweaks a few things about sentry guns that personally annoyed me.  

* Increases the ammo in automatic mode to result in the same total damage as AP mode
* Increases accuracy in AP mode and slows it down slightly to actually match the skill description
* Reduces the range at which the sentry shoots at enemies in automatic mode (from 50m to 20m)
* Actually makes suppressed sentries less likely to be targeted by enemies like the skill description implies
* Allows sentries to shoot through hostages and bots
* Stops sentries from aiming at civilians and surrendering or tied down enemies
* Adds option to place sentries facing towards you when the sprint button is held during placement
* Fixes cases of not being able to place any more sentries as client when the host didn't spawn a requested sentry
